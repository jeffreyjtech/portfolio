## Reflections

### Lab 05 reflection

- Oh boy, was this a lab. The template codebase is very disorganized, and also had to be repurposed in fiddly ways, against the original intent of some features, to fulfill the lab requirements.
- Just to use the CSS as an example, there some elements receiving styling from 3 or 4 sources It wasn't until the last 15 minutes that I remembered the glory of "Find/Replace in Files".
- I went at it basically alone, and I think that was very much to my detriment since there's just so much going on in this application.
