      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeffrey Jenkins. I am a software developer with previous experience in medical device manufacturing and electrical engineering. Previously I maintained the testing equipment at a defibrillator manufacturer. That equipment verified the quality of our life-saving products before being delivered to customers. Iâ€™m a capable problem-solver and passionate about challenging myself to learn new skills. This passion drove me to change careers into the fast-paced industry of software development. My previous work gave me invaluable skills for this field. I learned how to put quality and the customerâ€™s needs first, strive for excellence in my work, and form relationships with my colleagues so that we can align with our organizationâ€™s mission. I know I can make a positive impact in whatever team and whatever work I engage with.ðŸ˜Ž",

I was responsible for a great deal of the game logic, which was programmed in JavaScript. My favorite features to implement were the click detection event handler and the plant growth timing event. The former worked by decoding attributes encoded into the HTML elements to respond appropriately to the user, and the latter manipulated living plant objects to change their appearance and maturity over time.",
